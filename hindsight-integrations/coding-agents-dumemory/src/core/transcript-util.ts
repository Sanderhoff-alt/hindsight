 *  ordinary USER messages and would otherwise be extracted as things the user said (#3023):
 *    <hook_prompt>        codex surfaces hook stdout/errors this way
 *    <task-notification>  Claude Code reports a background task's outcome — task id, tool-use id,
 *                         status; measured at 39 of these across 400 local transcripts, each one
 *                         the entire message
 *    <system-reminder>    same class; today it only rides inside `tool_result` blocks, which the
 *                         Claude reader already drops, so this is insurance against it moving
 *  `relevant_memories` has no producer anywhere in this repo — its first appearance was already a
 *  stripper, so it predates the code that copied it forward. Kept conservatively: a transcript can
 *  carry another injector's block, and an alternative that never matches costs nothing. Contrast
 *  `user_feedback`, dropped once its producer was: this package DID inject a `<user_feedback>`
 *  section above the memories block until raw recall was removed, and the stripper outlived it.
 *  Tag-structural, not content-guessing. The block is removed and any surrounding text KEPT — a
 *  message that is nothing but a wrapper then renders empty and is dropped as a no-content turn. */
