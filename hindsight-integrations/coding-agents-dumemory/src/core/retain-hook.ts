/**
 * Shared runtime for the Claude Code `Stop` hook: when a session ends, read its transcript,
 * normalize it, and write it back into the bank so the session compounds into memory. The retain
 * half of the plugin (the `UserPromptSubmit` hook in core/hook.ts is the recall half).
 *
 * Write-back is ON by default, and `retainSessions: false` turns it off for the scope it is set on
 * (global, `harnesses.<name>`, or the resolved bank's `banks.<id>` section) — the same flag the
 * opencode persistent-plugin honors for its mid-session cadence (see core/runtime.ts). It gates
 * ONLY the transcript write-back: recall, git ingest, seeding and the memory tools keep working,
 * which is what separates it from the `disabled` kill switch.
 *
 * The pure logic lives in `buildRetain` (path + client in, void out) so it's unit-testable
 * without stdin; `runRetainHook` is thin plumbing around it, mirroring `runHook`/`buildHookOutput`
 * in core/hook.ts.
